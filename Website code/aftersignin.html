            <p> Number of truck collisions is more by the side of highways compared to motorcycle collisions. There are around 147 North-South bound highways and 142 East-West bound highways. In general there are more accidents in north and south bound highways
                compared to east and west bound. </p>

            <p> Surprisingly from the data, the movement of the person at fault preceding collision shows that most accidents have occurred when the person was proceeding straight. Next highest are the “Making left turn”, “Changing lanes” and “Ran off road”
                with little variation in numbers. “Slowing/Stopping”,“Making right turn”,“Entering traffic” and “Making U-turn” are the least movement that cause accident. </p>

            <p> Number of killed victims are more on a clear day than any other extreme condition like “Snow”, “Rain” “Fog” or “Wind”. It can accounted that number of vehicles on road during extreme weather conditions are less and also people are more careful
                while driving which leads to lesser accidents. Also timely closure of roads and warning the people about weather conditions helps a lot. </p>
